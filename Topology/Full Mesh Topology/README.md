Full mesh topology
==========================

Full mesh topology is implemented by having each site manage multiple local repositories. 
Each site can only write to its own local repository, while replicating it to the other sites. 

### Configuration

These scripts will create full mesh topology in 2 steps. 

##### Script 1: Create local repositories on all sites 
For example, 'local-amsterdam' on Amsterdam, Bangkok, and Chicago.

How to create and execute the script:

Step 1: open mission-control Configuration script editor 

Create new script -> paste the `CreateLocalRepo` script in the editor. Save

Step 2: selecting repositories / new repository / select instances - select source instance and destination instances

Step 3: in apply scripts - select the `CreateLocalRepo` script and select the repositories

Step 4: in user input type the name of the local repository to create on all instances ('local-amsterdam')

##### Script 2: create multi-push replication for full mesh topology

Step 1: open mission-control configuration script editor 

Create new Script -> paste the `NewRepoReplication` script in the editor. Save

Step 2: selecting repositories / update repository / select instances - select replication source instance and destination instances

Step 3: in select repositories - select the source repos

Step 4: in apply scripts - select the `NewRepoReplication` script and select the source repositories

Step 5: in user input select the destination repos for each source
